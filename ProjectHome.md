Puts a default text in form fields, commonly used in the search fields. When the user hint in the field, and then start typing, the default text disappears.

The plugin weighs less than 1kb, is really light & fast.

Receives only one parameter (the default text), which is optional, because you can use the default value of the field. You can find some examples in the [Wiki](Examples.md).
